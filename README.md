OGC Testkit – Independent Validation Lab

This repository hosts the independent testbed for the role-calculus framework (O–G–C).
The aim is to reproduce, validate, and extend the results using published datasets and transparent simulations.

Scope

T1 Orientation (Identity check): radial slopes, Gauss law identities.

T2 Coherence (Cross-spectra): $C_1(k)$ bands, null shuffles.

T3 Hysteresis & Plateaus: thresholds $(\Theta_\uparrow, \Theta_\downarrow)$, loop areas, dwell times.

Dynamic Cycles: experimental number-doubling systems (3–6–9 pattern, esoteric analogies).

All tests are designed to be minimal surprise implementations: open-source code, bootstrap/jackknife CIs, and reproducible null pipelines.
